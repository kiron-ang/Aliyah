Working examples 
1. `error_test.py` - working visualization and purposeful errors 
2. `rendering_example.py` - full minst model that trains 
3. `tiny_render.py` - small network, main thread might lock and crash randomly though 

---

Most examples do work and have been made with a specfic use case in mind as i've developed iteratively.

Some examples won't render layouts due to being made before I did the visualization hooks in the library.
