# Aliyah

---

Work in progress 

Being able to see to see my model train and interact with it in the terminal is important to me 

Wrapper libary in `/python`


```bash 
pip install aliyah 
```

---

## Installation 

Using package managers 
```bash 
cargo install aliyah # Rust CLI  
pip install aliyah # Python Hook Library  
```

Using curl 
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovechants/Aliyah/main/install.sh | bash
```

Using python 
```bash
python -m pip install aliyah
python -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovechants/Aliyah/main/install.py)"
```

From source 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lovechants/Aliyah.git
cd Aliyah
cargo build --release
pip install -e python/
```

data folder is for example scripts only (if building from source)

## Quick Start 
After installing the tool and library you can add monitoring to your code very simply 


```python 
# Inside your training code
with trainingmonitor() as monitor:
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
            # Your training code
            loss = ...
            accuracy = ...
            
            # Log metrics
            monitor.log_batch(batch_idx, loss, accuracy)
            
            # Check if user paused/stopped
            if not monitor.check_control():
                break
        
        # Log epoch metrics
        monitor.log_epoch(epoch, val_loss, val_accuracy)
```

Keyboard Controls

q/ESC : Quit

p/SPACE: Pause/Resume training

s     : Stop training

e     : Toggle error log

â†‘/â†“   : Scroll error log | Scroll training log 

c     : Clear error log

h     : Show this help

tab/n : Show node information 

click : Switch training and node panel

o     : Output panel 


You can visualize and track more data depending on what you decide is best to send and monitor 
Examples are provided that show in-depth metric tracking and visualization control in `/examples`
Full documentation for each function is in the works, for now you can look at the source code in the `/python` directory to see what you can send

## Features

#### Real time visualization 
See real time visualization of your model architecture showing activations and connections between layers. Learn insights into each node and edge as the model learns. 

#### Trainign Metrics 
Monitor key metrics in accordance to your model in real time with an interactive log and real time chart. Custom metrics can be sent between both using `**KWARG` in associated functions

#### System Resource Monitoring 
Keep track of CPU, GPU, and memory usage while the model trainings

#### Interactive Control 
Pause, resume, or stop training wthout killing the process, allowing you to have real time control as your model trains. 

#### Real time prediction 
Check how your model is performing wiht the prediction panel as your model trains

## Framework Support 

âœ… PyTorch
ðŸš§JAX
ðŸš§ TensorFlow/Keras
ðŸš§ Scikit-Learn
ðŸš§ TinyGrad

Contributions and suggestions to framework hooks and behaviors are appreciated 
Likewise, any framework that you'd like to see feel free to contribute or make an issue 

---

## Examples 

Checkout the examples for sample scripts and usage 

- `simpleNet.py` - A simple nerual network training on MNIST data, active visualizations and metric logging 
- `example_vae.py` - An example autoencoder adapted from PyTorch, showing custom metrics and active visualizations as well as custom prediction panel 
- `error_test.py` - Will show how the error log & are recorded in the TUI 

There are a variety of other scripts there for testing features feel free to look at them if using another framework outside of PyTorch 
###### Visualization hooks differ from framework to framework so as more get implemented better examples for each supported framework will be added
